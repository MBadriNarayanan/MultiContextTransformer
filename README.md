# Sign Language Translation using Multi Context Transformer

This repository contains code for the paper "Sign Language Translation using Multi Context Transformer", presented at the 20th Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021), Mexico City, Mexico.

We discuss an efficient solution to continuous sign language translation in our paper. The dataset used is [RWTH Phoenix-14T](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX-2014-T) which contains german sign langauge videos along with their corresponding translation.  

Paper published in Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI).
